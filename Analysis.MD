# Project 1: College Recruitment Improvement Study
## Survey: CCM Computing Literacy Course Entry Survey - Fall 2022

### Basic Demographics

*Note: All calculations for this section are found in worksheet PIVOT.*

**1. How many students from each class responded to the survey?**

CMP 101 - 28  
CMP 126 - 22  
CMP 135 - 81  
Total - 131  

**2. What are the gender percentages?**

Man - 39.7%  
Woman - 58.8%  
Prefer not to say - 1.5%  
Total - 100.0%  

**3. What is the racial/ethnic diversity?  For those students selecting more than one race/ethnicity, assign multi-racial to their category.**

Of the students who chose to respond to this question, the ethnic and racial make up is as follows:  
White/Caucasian - 52 (39.7%)  
Hispanic or Latino - 31 (23.7%)  
Black/African American - 13 (9.9%)  
Asian - 11 (8.4%)  
Multi-racial - 19 (14.5%)  
Total - 126 (96.2%)  

Five survey participants, or 3.8%, chose not to provide a response to this question.

**4. What is the age distribution for the survey?**

18 and younger - 33.6%  
19-20 - 33.6%  
21-24 - 16.8%  
25-34 - 12.2%  
35-64 - 3.8%  
Total - 100.0%

### Disaggregation of Data

**1. For a selected population, discover at least two things about this group.**  

For individuals who identified that there was a reason to take a computer literacy course other than it being a couse prerequisite (20 out of 131): 
- Thirteen identified as men and were split in near-equal counts in terms of ethnicity (4 White/Caucasian, 3 Asian, 2 Hispanic or Latino, 2 Black/African American, 2 Multi-Racial). 
- Two of those 13 did not select a motivation for taking the course (i.e., all answers to that question were marked as "No").  From the other 11, more than 50% (7 of 11) chose motivations related to work or money (e.g. Career Advancement, Career Change, Professional Development).

*N.B.: It should be noted that in each of these instances, the population is small enough that it may not be statistically relevant.*

**2. Answer two questions from your previously submitted Project 1 questions.**

**a. For non-Computer Science students answering the question “How interested are you in taking more courses in Computer Science, Information Technology or Game Development?” with (4) Somewhat Interested or (5) Extremely Interested, which majors are they?** (worksheet PIVOT)  
  
Radiography - 6  
Criminal Justice - 5  
Nursing - 3  
Business Administration - 1  
Liberal Arts - 1  
Undeclared - 2  

**b. (i) For non-Computer Science students identifying as female, are there any trends in their motivation for taking a literacy course?  (ii) For those selecting “IT Industry Certifications,” what are their demographics and current major?** (worksheet NON-PIVOT)

i.  Of the total population of 131, there were 77 who identified as women.  The vast majority (71 of 77) took the class only because they were required.  Other responses, which may overlap with those participants who identified their motivation as being a required class, tend to be lean towards non-job reasons.  42% said they wanted to keep current with technology, 29% took the course out of curiosity, and 31% for personal enrichment.  43% did state their motivation as being for career advancement.

ii.  There were 6 women in this population.
- 1 White/Caucasian, 3 Hispanic or Latino, 1 Black/African American, 1 Asian.
- 2, 18 and younger; 2, 19-20; 1, 21-24; 1, 25-34
- 3 Radiography, 1 Criminal Justice, 1 Exercise Science, and 1 Liberal Arts

### Additional Insights

From the data received in the survey, 77 women provided responses.  The top five degree programs for these participants were Criminal Justice (26%), Liberal Arts (16%), Nursing (16%), Radiography (13%), and Early Childhood Education (10%).  The IT Department may wish to consider discussing with these other academic departments ways in which technology can be integrated into the curriculum beyond the single course requirement.  For instance, introducing courses related to data science to the Nursing department to spark interest in health analytics may be fruitful.

Considering the responses of the total pool of survey participants, no participant responded that they had attended technology-related events prior to their enrollment in CCM (question 4).  These included the CyberSecurity Information Protection Program as well as the Hour of Code.  The IT Department should consider further outreach to area high schools to promote events that are technology related to perhaps interest students who may not have previously considered this area of study.
